\ This is the iOS port of IBNIZ.  Swipe left to read IBNIZ help. Here are some features to check out:
\ Custom keyboard: you can switch back and forth by hitting the KB button. With the custom keyboard, long press any key for opcode reference.

\ For each pixel, IBNIZ pushes a value for t, y, and x onto the stack. To put a solid color onto the screen, pop these three values off the stack and put a 16.16 fixed point value onto the stack yyuu.vvvv.
\ Remove the beginning slash below to see it in action.  Long press p on the keyboard to get help about the p opcode.
  \ ppp DBDB.FFFF

\ The UP and DOWN buttons will increment and decrement the number at the cursor, move your cursor to the first F after the period and try, watch the color get darker.

\ Let's just display x on the screen, use the x and p opcode to do this.
  \ xpxp

\ Notice the bands, the coordinate system is -1..1 encoded as FFFF.0000 to 0000.FFFF
\ Let's get Y
  \ pxp

\ Get help by swiping left, load/save programs by swiping left again

\ Swipe right to do a full screen

\ Shake to disable swipe and send touches to the U opcode. Try it below.
